Hybrid Urban-rural Integrated Modeling with Open Reproducible Infrastructure in Korea

## Why `huimori`?
- _huimori_[휘모리] is the fastest rhythm in traditional Korean folk music. The naming is influenced from the parent package `beethoven` and its family, all of which are inspired by the name of classical musicians. To match the use of this package in Korea, I wanted to use Korean (albeit alphabetized) for this. As named, I aimed to design this package to provide potential users the _fastest_ implementation of reproducible air pollution modeling (currently putting emphasis in particulate matter) harnessed by the power of `targetopia` and geospatial packages.
