- _huimori_[휘모리] is the fastest rhythm in traditional Korean folk music. The naming is influenced from the parent package `beethoven` and its family, all of which are inspired by the name of Western classical musicians. To match the naming protocol of this package in Korea, I nudged the protocol to use Korean, and a rhythm name (albeit alphabetized) for this. The package provides potential users the _fastest_ implementation of reproducible air pollution modeling (currently putting emphasis in particulate matter) harnessed by the power of `targetopia` and geospatial packages.


## Final objective
Our goal is to provide hourly, 10-meter resolution air pollution prediction outputs for the entire South Korea from 2010 to 2023 (and onwards). The outputs will be available in GeoTIFF format at the highest compression level.
